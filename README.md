# Dummy-release-test
Release GHA are plaguing me, so this repo is for testing purposes

There seems to be various ways that releases are built, so we will find
out how this goes.

Some primary triggers of the workflows seems to be with tags, so let's
start with an an initial release using a git tag.

# General Notes:

## v0.0.1 - v0.0.2

Oops forgot to push the tags

## v0.0.3

The artifacts didn't go through, but that may be a problem with forgetting to add them.

Furthermore, Windows was broken due to not adding .exe to the end of the file, so trying
to add a wildcard on there.
